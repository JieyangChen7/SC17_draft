Since different HPC system usually have different software and hardware configurations, configure and build before running HPC application can take a lot of time and effort for application users. Also, when a HPC system is shared between users and each user gets limited time slots, which is usually not enough to finish their computation process. This requires them to implement checkpoint/restoration feature, so that they can resume work when resources are available. However, these kind of checkpoint cannot be easily migrate to other available machines. Container technology like Docker brings great benefits to application's development, build and deployment process, which can effectively solve issues that HPC users are facing. While most cloud computing systems are already equipped with Docker, not much work has been done to deploy Docker on HPC systems. In this work, we propose a Docker-enable build and execution environment for HPC system -- \texttt{BEE}. It brings all the benefits of Docker and does not require system administrative level configuration. we show that current HPC application can be easily configured to run BEE. It eliminates the need for application configurations and build, also provides comparable performance.
