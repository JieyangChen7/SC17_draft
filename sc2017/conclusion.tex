\section{Conclusions}
    \label{sec:conclusions}
In this work, we first address the problems that current HPC users are facing. Then, we analysis the potential of integrating commonly used Docker container technology into the existing HPC system to build a consistent container environment for HPC users. Following this goal, we propose several goals that a successful containerized HPC framework should achieve and we design a Docker-enabled HPC framework -- BEE. BEE achieves all the goals we set and also allows users to use the compute resources of both existing HPC system and cloud computing system with no extra configuration work.
Experiments show that BEE can achieve comparable storage I/O performance and computing capability. Finally, case study on widely used VPIC simulation tool is tested on BEE and native HPC system for performance comparison.
