\section{Future Work}
    \label{sec:discussion}
In the next stage of this work, we will focus on several part. 
\begin{enumerate}

\item We will continue optimize the performance of BEE in terms of storage I/O, computing and network communication. 

\item We will continue to prefect our BEE framework. We will add more flexible and adaptive scheduling strategies and more sophisticated resource management system into BEE framework. 

\item Our current work can only utilize general CPUs, we will extend our BEE framework to utilizes accelerators such as GPU and Intel Xeon Phi, since accelerators are commonly used in HPC application. 

\item We will Integrate system level checkpoint/restoration capability into BEE. It can greatly benefit applications that do not native application level checkpoint/restoration capability built-in.

\end{enumerate}
