\section{Future Work}
    \label{sec:discussion}
In the next stage of this work, we will focus on several part. First, we will continue optimize the performance of BEE in terms of storage I/O, computing and network communication. Second, we will continue to prefect our BEE framework. We will add more flexible and adaptive scheduling strategies and more sophisticated resource management system into BEE framework. Third, our current work can only utilize general CPUs, we will extend our BEE framework to utilizes accelerators such as GPU and Intel Xeon Phi, since accelerators are commonly used in HPC application.
